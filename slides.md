# Blockchain Technologies

## Introduction

Three sections:

1. Blockchain primitives and some history
2. Layer 2 technologies
3. Advanced cryptography

## What is a blockchain?

Prepend-only linked list with cryptographic verification features that is read
in reverse by convention and maintained by a replicated state machine governed
by a consensus mechanism.

---

# Blockchain Primitives

## Blitzkrieg Explication

Three + 1 kinds of primitives:

1. Cryptography
2. Data structure
3. Consensus
4. Virtual machine

---

# Cryptography

Two cryptographic primitives used in blockchains:

1. Cryptographic hash functions
2. Digital signature algorithms

---

# Cryptographic Hash Functions

A function _`h`_ that takes a variable length input and produces a fixed length
output. It must have the following qualities:

1. Deterministic computation: given an input _`I`_, the output _`O = h(I)`_ will be the same
every time it is calculated.
2. Collision resistance: given inputs _`I1`_ and _`I2`_ and outputs _`O1 = h(I1)`_ and
_`O2 = h(I2)`_, the likelihood that _`O1 == O2`_ is astronomically low as long as _`I1 != I2`_.
E.g. in SHA256 with 2^256 possible outputs, that likelihood is approximately 1/2^256.
(2^256 â‰ˆ 10^77; there are estimated to be about 10^80 atoms in the universe, or about 1000 atoms
per SHA256 output)
3. Irreversible: given an output _`O = h(I)`_, it is impossible to calculate the input _`I`_.
4. Unpredictable: given an input _`I`_ and output _`O = h(I)`_, it is impossible to predict how
_`O`_ will change after some change to _`I`_.

# Presenter Notes

10^80 is called the Eddington number.

# Example using SHA256 bitstrings:

Inputs:

- 00000000
- 00000001

Outputs and their XOR:

- 110111000110100000010111001110011111111101100110111101010011000100111001010...
- 100101111110101000100100010111100110100010001010101010011000101001110111101...
- 010010111000001000110011011001111001011111101100010111001011101101001110111...

Changing 1 input bit changes approximately half of the output bits.

# Digital Signature Algorithms

A digital signature algorithm can be described in four functions:

1. Private key generator: `prvkey = f1(seed)`
2. Public key generator/deriver: `pubkey = f2(prvkey)`
3. Signer of arbitrary data using a private key: `sig = f3(data, prvkey)`
4. Verifier of signatures using a public key: `valid = f4(sig, data, pubkey)`,
which returns false if the signature is not valid for the data and the public key.

# Presenter Notes

A system for creating cryptographic proofs using a private key that can be
verified by anyone with the corresponding public key. Can be used for authenticaiton,
authorization, or attestation.

---

# Digital Signature Algorithms

Probabilistic security guarantees:

1. Authentication: ensure the signer of a block of data is who they claim to be.
2. Integrity: ensure the content of the block of data has not been altered since
it was signed.
3. Non-repudiation: prevent the signer from denying that they signed the data
block, providing evidence of their attestation of or interaction with the data.

# Presenter Notes

Modern digital signature algorithms provide the following probabilistic security
guarantees. Elliptic curve DSA and Schnorr are most common, but lattice-based
post-quantum DSAs are being finalized by NIST (Signal protocol already adopted
a PQ latice system for DHE and DSA).

---

# Data Structures

Both fundamental blockchain data structures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs):

1. Linked list
2. Merkle tree

---

# Linked List

A linked list is a sequence of items that each contain a reference (link) to the
next item in the sequence.

<pre>
item0 = {
    data0,
    link_to_item1
}

item1 = {
    data1,
    link_to_item2
}
</pre>

---

# Linked List

In effect, a linked list is a directed graph where each node has in-degree and
out-degree each of either 0 or 1.

[node] --> [node] --> [node]

In a blockchain, the order is reversed by convention:

[block] <-- [block] <-- [block]

Importantly, the way that edges in this graph are encoded (hash function)
makes the formation of a cycle impossible. Hence, a blockchain is a directed
acyclic graph with maximum in-degree and out-degree of 1 for each node.

---

# Merkle Tree

<pre>
[leaf0] [leaf1] [leaf2] [leaf3]
     \     /      \     /
     [node0]      [node1]
           \      /
            [root]

node0 = hash(hash(leaf0) || hash(leaf1))
node1 = hash(hash(leaf2) || hash(leaf3))
root = hash(node0 || node1)
</pre>

A Merkle tree is a tree structure that uuses a cryptographic hash function to
combine a number of items, called "leaves", in pairs to form nodes, then
recursively combines nodes in pairs until it arrives at a single value, called
the root.

# Presenter Notes

- Diagrams are normally upside down with the root at the top and the leaves
at the bottom, but that's not how trees work.
- A Merkle tree is also a directed acyclic graph: the root links to the nodes
above/before it, and those nodes link to prior nodes or leaves. The way these
links are encoded and aggregated (cryptographic hash function) ensures that
cycles are impossible.

---

# Merkle Tree

<pre>
[leaf0] [leaf1] [leaf2] [leaf3]
     \     /      \     /
     [node0]      [node1]
           \      /
            [root]

node0 = hash(hash(leaf0) || hash(leaf1))
node1 = hash(hash(leaf2) || hash(leaf3))
root = hash(node0 || node1)
</pre>

## Proof for leaf1

<pre>
bool verify(root, leaf, proof) {
    let sum <- hash(leaf)
    for step in proof {
        if step is right {
            sum <- hash(sum || step)
        } else {
            sum <- hash(step || sum)
        }
    }
    return sum == root
}

proof = [{hash(leaf0): left}, {node1: right}]
assert verify(root, leaf1, proof)
</pre>

# Presenter Notes

- A Merkle tree root commits to a data set of arbitrary size.
- Using a Merkle tree, a data set inclusion proof can be generated with size
that scales with the logarithm of the number of set members.

# Merkle Tree (Taproot Edition)

<pre>
[leaf0] [leaf1] [leaf2] [leaf3]
     \     /      \     /
     [node0]      [node1]
           \      /
            [root]

node0 = xor(hash(hash(leaf0)), hash(hash(leaf1)))
node1 = xor(hash(hash(leaf2)), hash(hash(leaf3)))
root = xor(hash(node0), hash(node1))
</pre>

## Proof for leaf1

<pre>
bool verify(root, leaf, proof) {
    let sum <- leaf
    for step in proof {
        sum <- xor(hash(sum), hash(step))
    }
    return sum == root
}

proof = [leaf0, node1]
assert verify(root, leaf1, proof)
</pre>

# Presenter Notes

- With the Taproot upgrade, the Bitcoin core dev team introduced a new, more
flexible version of the Merkle tree that removes handedness in proofs.

---

# Merkle Tree (theoretical faulty version)

<pre>
[leaf0] [leaf1] [leaf2] [leaf3]
     \     /      \     /
     [node0]      [node1]
           \      /
            [root]

node0 = xor(hash(leaf0), hash(leaf1))
node1 = xor(hash(leaf2)), hash(leaf3))
root = xor(node0, node1)
</pre>

## Proof algorithm

<pre>
bool verify(root, leaf, proof) {
    let sum <- hash(leaf)
    for step in proof {
        sum <- xor(sum, step)
    }
    return sum == root
}
</pre>


---

# Merkle Tree (theoretical faulty version)

<pre>
[leaf0] [leaf1] [leaf2] [leaf3]
     \     /      \     /
     [node0]      [node1]
           \      /
            [root]

node0 = xor(hash(leaf0), hash(leaf1))
node1 = xor(hash(leaf2)), hash(leaf3))
root = xor(node0, node1)
</pre>

## Proof algorithm and hack

<pre>
bool verify(root, leaf, proof) {
    let sum <- hash(leaf)
    for step in proof {
        sum <- xor(sum, step)
    }
    return sum == root
}

spoof = xor(node1, hash(newleaf))
assert verify(root, newleaf, [spoof, node1])
</pre>

# Presenter Notes

- By including the intermediate hashing step, now the attacker must find
a preimage for the spoofed node derived from the xor operation, which is
computationally infeasible.

---

# Consensus Mechanisms

## Two types

- Trusted: RAFT, Paxos, proof-of-authority, etc
- Trustless: proof-of-work
- Depends: proof-of-stake

## Proof-of-work

- Probabilistic settlement mechanism: accumulation of reinforcing proofs-of-work
reduces likelihood of successful rewrite
- Hashcash: difficulty defined as preceding null bits in a hash function output
- Invented by Adam Back to fix email spam, then used by Satoshi in Bitcoin for
consensus

# Presenter Notes

- Proof-of-stake: trusted if initial minting and distribution were manual;
trustless if initial minting and distribution were proof-of-work
- I have not experimented with non-PoW enough to say anything definitive
- Most problems can be solved without consensus, which is costly; e.g. CRDTs (which I have implemented)

# History Detour: Bitcoin Whitepaper

[bitcoin.pdf](bitcoin.pdf)

# Presenter Notes

- Scroll through, read section headers, and mention relevant technological primitives
- Note that something important is missing from the whitepaper; see if anyone in the audience can guess

---

# Virtual Machine

Bitcoin script system: implementation detail omitted from whitepaper. All
digital signatures are supplied in the form of unlocking scripts (witness data)
that evaluates with the locking script to `true`. "Bitcoin Script is a language
for expressing challenges that lock the coins. Bitcoin Script was designed to
ensure low verification cost and enable running a Bitcoin node on low-tier
hardware." (Coinpool whitepaper)

Example locking script:

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubkey hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

Example unlocking script:

```
<signature> <pubkey>
```

# Presenter Notes

- Pay-to-pubkey-hash example
- Stack machine: unlocking script executes first
- The source of Bitcoin's L2 capabilities
- Bitcoin script has changed significantly over the years, primarily through
soft-forks (templates) and node policies (disabling or redefining ops)

# Layer 2 (aka Off-Chain Solutions)

Blockchains are inefficient databases and trade throughput for decentralization
(or rather decentralization theater/hype in most cases). Scaling throughput is
attempted via layer-2/off-chain systems that use on-chain transactions for
initialization and settlement.

---

# Payment Channels

Problem: Alice and Bob want to pay each other without incurring fees for each payment.

Solution:

1. Deposit funds into a multi-sig wallet
2. Create a floating transaction that refunds themselves
3. Create a new floating txn that updates balances and invalidates old floating
txn for each payment
4. Settle eventually by confirming the latest floating txn on the blockchain

# Presenter Notes

- Payment channel protocols rely upon the capabilities of the underlying protocol
- Current Lightning Network system uses a punishment clause to prevent abuse but
wrecks faulty nodes
- Several proposals exist for new L2 systems, e.g. Coinpool (2 sig flags + 1 op)
and Eltoo (1 sig flag + 1 op change)

---

# Payment Channel Networks

Problem: Alice wants to pay Carla but does not have a payment channel with her,
but both have a payment channel with Bob.

Solution: route payments through Bob.

1. Alice constructs an HTLC txn paying Bob.
2. Bob contstructs an HTLC txn paying Carla.
3. Alice releases the hash lock. Bob and Carla get paid simultaneously.

This model generalizes as long as a payment route with sufficient liquidity can
be found. (Payment routing is its own topic.)

# Presenter Notes

- I have not finished implementing any greedy routing algorithms, so I can't say
anything definitive yet
